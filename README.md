# NeuroMind

NeuroMind is an AI-enhanced real-time fMRI neurofeedback system designed to combat clinical depression.

## Overview

Depression affects over 280 million people worldwide, with many unable to receive the care they need due to barriers such as access, stigma, and unpredictable treatment outcomes. NeuroMind aims to address this pressing issue by combining cutting-edge technology with mental health care.

## Features

- AI-enhanced real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF)
- Personalized therapy option
- Non-invasive treatment
- Precise targeting of brain regions
- Real-time feedback and adjustments
- User-friendly interface for clinicians and patients

## Technology Stack

- **Data Source**: OpenNeuro dataset
- **Data Preprocessing**: Python, NiLearn, NiBabel
- **AI Model**: 3D Convolutional Neural Network, Multi-layer Perceptron
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Motion correction, spatial normalization, skull stripping, and smoothing
2. **AI Model**: Split architecture for independent learning of valence and arousal
3. **Real-time Data Processing Pipeline**: For live fMRI data during neurofeedback sessions
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Real-time adjustment of neurofeedback parameters
5. **User Interface**: Displays real-time brain activation maps and AI recommendations

## Development Process

1. Data sourcing and preprocessing
2. AI model development and training
3. Web application development
4. Extensive testing and validation
5. Real-time data processing pipeline implementation

## Impact

NeuroMind aims to improve treatment outcomes for individuals suffering from depression by offering precise and personalized neurofeedback. The project has the potential to revolutionize mental health care, making it more accessible, personalized, and effective.
